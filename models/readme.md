For a complete jig print:
- 1x Plate Jig - Base
- 1x Plate Jig - Mask
- 2x Plate Jig - Arms
- 4x Plate Jig - Clip*
*Clip style is up to the user but "mask down" when combined with a mask printed out of flexible material like TPU, TPE, or Nylon may be most effective; however this is currently untested

The Base has a small hole in the upper right corner to insert a small piece of filament indicating what should be the A1 corner of the plate
Hinges were designed to use 1.75mm diameter filament as the pin
Plate Clip (Hinged) is a deprecated design but might be useful in particular applications
.stl files are the base models and are printable on any 3D printer that fits the design
.3mf files were created specifically for BambuStudio with the intention of multi-colored printing
